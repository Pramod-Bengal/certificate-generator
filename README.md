# Certificate Generator

A proprietary certificate generation application developed for EyeQDotnet Pvt. The application generates personalized certificates in both vertical and horizontal orientations from Excel data.

## Features

- Generate certificates in vertical and/or horizontal orientations
- Read data from Excel files
- User-friendly GUI for orientation selection
- Automatic output organization in separate folders
- Sanitized filenames for compatibility

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required font files:
  - `arial.ttf`

## Required Files

Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:
- `generate.py` (main script)
- `cert_vertical.pdf` (vertical certificate template)
- `cert_horizontal.pdf` (horizontal certificate template)
- Excel file containing certificate data with columns:
  - "Name"
  - "Certificate_Number"

## Installation

1. Download the project files
2. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install pandas PyPDF2 reportlab
```

## Usage

1. Place your certificate templates in the project directory:
   - `cert_vertical.pdf` for vertical certificates
   - `cert_horizontal.pdf` for horizontal certificates

2. Prepare your Excel file with the following columns:
   - "Name": The name to appear on the certificate
   - "Certificate_Number": The unique certificate number

3. Run the script:
```bash
python generate.py
```

4. Follow the GUI prompts:
   - Select your Excel file when prompted
   - Choose orientation(s) using checkboxes
   - Click "Generate" to create certificates

5. Generated certificates will be saved in:
   - `output_vertical/` for vertical certificates
   - `output_horizontal/` for horizontal certificates

## Creating Windows Executable

To create a standalone Windows executable:

1. Install PyInstaller:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Create the executable:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile generate.py
```

3. The executable will be created in the `dist` directory

### Important Notes for Executable:
- Copy your certificate templates (`cert_vertical.pdf` and `cert_horizontal.pdf`) to the same directory as the executable
- Font files will be included automatically in the executable
- Make sure your Excel file is accessible when running the executable

## Troubleshooting

1. **Font Errors**:
   - Ensure `arial.ttf` and `arialbd.ttf` are in the project directory
   - On Windows, you can copy these from `C:\Windows\Fonts\`

2. **File Not Found Errors**:
   - Verify certificate templates are named correctly
   - Check that templates are in the same directory as the script/executable

3. **Excel File Issues**:
   - Confirm column names are exactly "Name" and "Certificate_Number"
   - Make sure the Excel file is not open in another program
